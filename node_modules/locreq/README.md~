# locreq

`locreq` allows you to easiily require modules from your project, without worrying about realtive paths.

Assume the following directory structure:

```
- lib
  - collectionA
	- moduleA1.js
	- moduleA2.js
  - collectionB
	- collectionB1
	  - moduleB1a.js
```

Now, to require module `A2.js` from module `B1a.js`, using regular `require`:

```
require("../../collectionA/moduleA2.js");
```

There are a few problems with the above example:

* it has a high cognitive overhead;
* when you move the `B1a.js` file, you have to update the argument to `require`;
* it's hard to search for all files that require the `A2` module.
